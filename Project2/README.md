Mini Project 2 is the next step to my mini project 1 but I went a bit backwards.
Mini project 1 generated travel itineraries.
For my Mini project 2 I used React to complete my Home Page.
The home page consists of a Nav, Header, Destination, and Quote generator.
Each components has their assigned jsx and module.css.
I'm using Module.CSS files for organization and avoiding class name conflict.
The Assets folder has saved Destination Images.  
For the Destination component, I want to expand and link it to my itineraries from Mini Project 1.
Lastly, I have a quote generator with React useState Hook.
The Destination component I want to expand and link it to my itineraries from Mini Project 1.
To expand my project I would like to link all projects together (Homepage, Itineraries, Destinations, Sign up/Login,).
Adding a community page is also something I would like to add for others to add itineraries,pictures, journal/document their trips, and share.
